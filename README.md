# Generative-modelling-reading-group

Reading group dedicated to understanding the fundamental advances in generative modelling, identifying connections and new research directions.

**When:** Wednesdays at 11 am.

**Zoom link** (only if you really cannot make it in person): ![https://mit.zoom.us/j/97422870792](https://mit.zoom.us/j/97422870792).

**Recording:** generally not recorded, but please ask the next presenter to record if you cannot make it.

**Important:** Zoom link and recording should not be a regular excuse not to attend.

**Rules:**

1) We pick papers of general interest (i.e., no heavy neuro or molecular biology papers unless they truly introduce a general idea beyond the field)
2) Everyone reads the paper beforehand
3) One person presents with slides
4) Everyone asks questions to understand the paper
5) We break up into groups of 2-3 and collect subjective perspectives on the topic
6) We reconvene to share ideas and identify promising research directions
