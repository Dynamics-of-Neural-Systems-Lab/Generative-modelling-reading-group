# Generative-modelling-reading-group

Reading group dedicated to understanding the fundamental advances in generative modelling, identifying connections and new research directions.

**When:** Wednesdays at 11 am.

**When:** AI Institute meeting room.

**Zoom link** (only if you really cannot make it in person): [https://mit.zoom.us/j/97422870792](https://mit.zoom.us/j/97422870792).

**Recording:** generally not recorded, but please ask the next presenter to record if you cannot make it.

**Important:** Zoom link and recording should not be a regular excuse not to attend.

## Rules and guidelines

1) We pick papers of general interest (i.e., no heavy neuro or molecular biology papers unless they truly introduce a general idea)
2) Everyone reads the paper beforehand
3) One person presents with slides
5) Everyone asks questions to understand the paper
6) We break up into groups of 2-3 and collect subjective perspectives on the topic
7) We reconvene to share ideas and identify promising research directions

## Tips for an effective presentation

1) Say what you will say. Have an up-front slide describing the take-home messages and why the paper should be worth remembering.
2) Link the paper to other papers (mathematically and conceptually), especially those that have already been covered in previous sessions.
3) Either explain something properly or leave it out. This is especially true for mathematical innovations. A formula will be forgotten, but explaining the core idea and, in many cases, the proof can be very insightful.
4) Examples, examples. Examples are essential to understanding any theory, but in ML, this is twice as true because experiments usually indicate the type of data the algorithm is designed to work on.
5) Say what you have said. Conclude with a slide that describes how the innovations fit in the bigger picture.
6) Raise points of discussion. If you have found something difficult to understand, chances are those bits are worth discussing.
